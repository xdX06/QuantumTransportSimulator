# QuantumTransportSimulator
This framework implements a 3D quantum transport simulation system based on nanoscale FinFET devices, which is capable of simulating electron transport processes considering quantum effects. The framework is written in C++ with high performance and scalability, and supports the following functions: accurate simulation of 3D device structure, adaptive tuning of quantum effect corrections, solution of the self-consistent Poisson Schrödinger equation, carrier dynamics considering the influence of interfacial states, coupling of drift-diffusion model and quantum effects, and generation and analysis of device characteristic curves.
